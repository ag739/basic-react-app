# Basic React App

My first try at creating a basic React app. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Includes a homepage and a placeholder page and working links using [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom).

## To Run

`npm start`

## Components

* App - a component to manage the navigation from page to page
* AppHome - the `index` page
* AppPage - a placeholder page, created for the sole purpose of testing navigation
* Carousel - a slideshow animated with CSS
* Footer - a page footer with customizable links
* LearnMore - a generic 'learn more' page with a title, image, and button
* NavBar - a fixed navigation bar that supports sublists

### Styles 

Uses a single scss file which automatically compiles to css when running

## Next steps

* Mobile friendly design (wanted to focus on creating some base styles first)
* Adding real content (all content on the page is placeholder content)
